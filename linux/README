The Makefile assumes you are using wxWindows 2.4.2, and that it is
installed in /usr (/usr/lib/, /usr/include/wx, etc...).  It may,
however, be in /usr/local instead; in this case modify line 18 of the
Makefile appropriately.

Also, wxWindows 2.4.2 has conflicts with very recent versions of GTK,
so you are welcome to use the most recent version of wxWindows
(2.6.0).  However, this would also require changing the Makefile,
namely lines 16-18.  Also, this new version of wxWindows splits the
libraries up into different parts; base, core, and gl.  You would need
to link to all these libraries.

If you email me at aseem@agarwala.org, I can send you a Makefile
customized to 2.6.

UPDATE: My code doesn't work with 2.6.  2.4.2 doesn't compile with
newer versions of g++.  So, this is a problem that I haven't had time
to fix.  Sorry.  You're only hope is to use an older g++.
